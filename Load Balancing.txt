What is Load Balancing

Load balancing is a network management technique that distributes network traffic across multiple servers to improve performance, availability, and resource utilization. It ensures that no single server is overwhelmed, preventing slowdowns or downtime during peak periods or unexpected traffic spikes. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Distributing Traffic:
A load balancer acts as a traffic controller, receiving incoming requests and directing them to different servers in a cluster. 
Improving Performance:
By spreading the workload, load balancing reduces the load on individual servers, allowing them to handle requests more efficiently, leading to faster response times. 
Enhancing Availability:
If one server in the cluster fails, the load balancer can automatically direct traffic to other healthy servers, ensuring continuous service availability. 
Optimizing Resource Utilization:
Load balancing helps maximize the use of available resources, preventing servers from being underutilized or overloaded, leading to cost savings and improved efficiency. 
Example:
Imagine a popular website experiencing a surge in traffic. A load balancer would distribute the incoming requests across multiple web servers, preventing any one server from being overwhelmed and causing the website to slow down or go offline. 
Load Balancing Algorithms:
Load balancers utilize various algorithms to determine which server receives a request. Common algorithms include round-robin, least connections, and geo-distributed load balancing.
