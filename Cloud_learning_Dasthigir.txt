That‚Äôs a great direction for your growth as a Build and Release Engineer. Here's a suggested learning sequence along with topics you must cover in each tool, structured to build your foundational knowledge first and then progress to advanced tools like Kubernetes and OpenShift.

Learning Sequence:

1. Basic Networking
2. DNS
3. Load Balancing
4. Docker
5. Kubernetes
6. OpenShift


1. Basic Networking

Start here since it's foundational for understanding cloud, containers, and orchestration.

‚úÖ Topics to Learn:
OSI Model: Understand the 7 layers and how data flows.

IP Addressing: IPv4, IPv6, subnetting, private vs public IPs.

Ports and Protocols: TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP.

Routing and Switching: Default gateways, NAT, firewalls.

CIDR and Subnetting: Network segmentation, subnets.

NAT and PAT: Internet access from internal networks.

VPNs and Tunneling

2. DNS (Domain Name System)
Helps map hostnames to IPs. Essential for services to communicate.

‚úÖ Topics to Learn:
What is DNS: Name resolution, FQDN.

DNS Record Types:

A, AAAA

CNAME

MX

NS

TXT (useful for verifications)

Forward vs Reverse DNS

TTL and Caching

Public DNS vs Internal DNS

Troubleshooting DNS with tools: nslookup, dig, host

3. Load Balancing
Critical in distributed/cloud systems.

‚úÖ Topics to Learn:
What is Load Balancing

Types:

Layer 4 (Transport): Based on IP and port

Layer 7 (Application): Based on HTTP content

Algorithms: Round-robin, Least Connections, IP Hash

Sticky Sessions

Health Checks

SSL Termination

Popular Tools: HAProxy, NGINX, AWS ELB, Traefik

4. Docker
Start containerization here.

‚úÖ Topics to Learn:
What is a container vs VM

Docker Architecture

Installing Docker

Docker CLI Commands

docker run, build, exec, logs, ps, images, network

Dockerfile: Creating custom images

Volumes: Persistent data

Networking in Docker

Bridge, Host, None, Custom Networks

Port Mapping

Docker Compose:

docker-compose.yml basics

Multi-container setups

Best Practices: Small images, non-root user, caching layers

Security basics: Docker Bench, image scanning

5. Kubernetes
Once you understand Docker well.

‚úÖ Topics to Learn:
Kubernetes Architecture:

Master node, Worker node, API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller

Kubernetes Objects:

Pods

ReplicaSets

Deployments

Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)

Namespaces

Networking in Kubernetes:

Cluster networking

CNI plugins

DNS in Kubernetes

Persistent Storage:

Volumes, Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

Config Management:

ConfigMaps, Secrets

Helm (Optional but useful): Package management for Kubernetes

RBAC (Security): Roles and bindings

Health Checks: Liveness and Readiness Probes

Logs and Monitoring: kubectl logs, Prometheus, Grafana

6. OpenShift
Builds on Kubernetes, Red Hat‚Äôs enterprise offering.

‚úÖ Topics to Learn:
OpenShift vs Kubernetes

Installing OpenShift CLI (oc)

Key OpenShift Concepts:

Projects (Namespaces)

Routes (vs Ingress in Kubernetes)

Source-to-Image (S2I)

Web Console Usage

RBAC and OAuth Integration

BuildConfig and ImageStream

CI/CD Pipelines (Tekton)

Monitoring and Logging

Security Context Constraints (SCC)

üß© Additional Tools to Explore Along the Way:
Git and GitOps: Use with ArgoCD or Flux for Kubernetes/OpenShift.

Container Registries: Docker Hub, Quay, Harbor

Cloud Providers: AWS/GCP/Azure (Basics of networking + managed Kubernetes/OpenShift services)
